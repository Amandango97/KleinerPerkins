            <p>
                    My mission is to build tools that help people reach their goals. I believe people can accomplish much more than they think, and equipping them with effective tools enables them to materialize their visions. There are many barriers, however, that stand in the way of achieving our goals. For example: unsupportive environments, a lack of self-belief, not having effective workflow systems, or simply not knowing which goals to pursue. I want to help people figure out what their goals are and build systems to overcome the barriers. Having the opportunity to empower and enable people using my skill-set is incredibly exciting and rewarding. It is a meta-solution: if I can help people achieve their own goals, my positive impact on the world is multiplied by the amount of impact they are able to have.
            </p>

                    Enabling people to reach their goals has been the thread underlying many of the initiatives I’ve done over the past 3 years. I study behavioral science, and am writing my thesis on personal rules with Dr. Angela Duckworth (author of Grit) and Dr. Katy Milkman. As a teaching assistant in both Wharton’s business and leadership course (WH101) and Schoolyard Venture’s high school entrepreneurship course, I have mentored younger students through the process of developing their sense of agency and learning how to take action in a new environment. The <a href="ourmerakicollective.com">Meraki Collective</a>, which I co-founded, is a student club that gives people accountability and a community with which to work on side-projects they care about. I built an app designed to nudge people towards gratitude, and developed a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16aQwtC4KqeiraHpzezCmlu49sQFRKENY0LCMXRJEvso/edit">question guide</a> that I used to coach 6 people through the exploration of their career goals. I am deeply motivated to continue this work.

                There is an abundance of exciting possibilities for how to help people reach their goals. Some that I’ve considered include:
            </p>      
                <ul>
                    <li>Giving people mental tools that improve their decision-making and introspection</li>
                    <li>Coaching to help people crystallize their goals and overcome mental blocks</li>
                    <li>Habit-forming systems like Fabulous and Coach.me</li>
                    <li>Bootcamps that help you discover and build your life philosophy</li>
                    <li>Productivity systems that improve our workflow</li>
                    <li>Nudges towards practicing habits that people endorse, like gratitude and meditation</li>
                    <li>Solutions using artificial intelligence to model the mind and help us improve our thinking and decision-making (similar to <a href="https://ought.org/mission">Ought</a>)</li>
                </ul>
            
            <p>
                    There is much uncharted territory in this area. Figuring out what goals to work toward that align with someone’s underlying values is a complicated task. I have yet to find an effective system that helps people work through the mental blocks preventing them from reaching their goals. As the science of goals continues to advance, I believe there will be many possibilities for products that can significantly improve people’s efficacy and help them find fulfilment.
